    "\n",
    "The following are hotkeys used within Jupyter for cell manipulation. Instead of compiling an entire page, one can run a single block (*cell*) of code at a time.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "__To use a hotkey, one must be in__ ___command mode___. If the cell is green on the left-hand side of the cell, it is not in command mode, which is in blue. To get into command mode, press either the `Esc` key or mouse click on the white space between the colored line and the cell. Once the line turns blue and you are in command mode, you can use any of the following hotkeys to manipulate Jupyter cells. A complete list of hotkeys can be found in the _Command Palette_ at the top of the Jupyter toolbar.\n",
    "- To delete a cell..................................... `d` key twice <br><br>\n",
    "- To undo cell deletion................................ `z` key<br><br>\n",
    "- To create a new cell above........................... `a` key (`b` key for new cell below)<br><br>\n",
    "- To convert a cell to HTML markup..................... `m` key (`y` key for coding cell)<br><br>\n",
    "- To cut and paste cells............................... `x` and `v` keys, respectively (`c` for copy)<br><br>\n",
    "- To access command mode of multiple cells at one time. `Shift` + up or down arrow keys.<br>\n",
    "    - This only allows you to access _consecutive_ multiple cells. You would have to change the order of the cells first before moving non-consecutive cells. This can be down by clicking the up or down arrows on the Jupyter toolbar (no hotkeys for those :/)<br><br>\n",
    "- To compile and run a cell............................. `Shift + Enter` keys (will move to next cell; do `Ctrl + Enter` if you want to stay on same cell)<br><br>\n",
    "- To toggle (hide/show) cell output..................... `O` key, or double click on the output with mouse.\n",

This error states that you have (at least) one too many variables not assigned by an equal sign (a \"positional argument\") _after_ the keyword argument, and so python doesn't know what to do with it. For example: `my_funct(x, y, z=111)` --> (calling) `my_func(x=1, y=22, z=44, 132)`. \n",

    "## Jupyter Markdown Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a language used to convey plain text in an IDE (instead of in-line comments in code). From pure Markdown, there are several \"Markup\" languages that provide advanced style formatting, such as CommonMark, GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), and R Markdown. Below are notes pertaining to the Markdown processor for Jupyter. While (I am pretty sure) the markdown processor is called \"nbconvert\", I will nonetheless refer to it as \"Jupyter Markdown\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is confusing that Markdown languages have several mark-up capabilities and yet are still identified as \"Markdown\" languages. Jupyter Markdown is included in this confusion, since it can render both Markdown and markup. Specifically, Jupyter Markdown offers basic manipulations of text, such as bolding and numbering lists, while it can also render _some_ HTML code, which is a \\[\"Hyper-Text\"\\] Markup Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the following notes are the extent of Jupyter Markdown, which render most things that HTML can ___except___:\n",
    "- Emoji shortcodes (like :joy: for the crying-laughing face).\n",
    "- Footnotes (would have to manually superscript a number containing a manual anchor and then do it again later on as the footnote).\n",
    "- Task Lists (with a \\[x\\]).\n",
    "- In-line code comes out as generic code. Only fenced block code can be formatted by programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is done in raw text cells in Jupyter so as to prevent Markdown rendering (i.e., you can see the code behind the Markdown without the code being executed)."
