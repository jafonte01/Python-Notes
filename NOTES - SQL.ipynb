    "\n",
    "### A. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of importing data from an existing table, we can alternatively create own table! ___However,___ in doing so, we need to do more than just set dimensions and input values. We need to name _everything_, set data types, add constraints if necessary, and of course, do it all without getting errors!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a simple table creation. Keep in mind this only creates the table - it does not have any values inputted into the newly created table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    some_column_name TYPE column_constraint,\n",
    "    column_2_name TYPE, \n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. What is TYPE?\n",
    "\n",
    "__TYPE__ is the defined data type of the values within that column - yes, all values within the same column MUST be the same data type (unless you define it as \"VarChar\" (variable characters), which is unadvised and should only be used (1) as a placeholder or (2) if the data type isn't important for that column and want to avoid errors during importing). \n",
    "<br><br>\n",

    "- TEXT \n",
    "- INTEGER \n",
    "- NUMERIC \n",
    "- VARCHAR(100) _(number of max characters, regardless of type)_\n",
    "- DATE. \n",
    "    - Check the internet for more data types!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Two Notes on VARCHAR(x)...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. VARCHAR is a good placeholder, but unless you plan on _not_ performing any querying operations on that column that require a certain data type (numerical operations, DATE-time operations, etc.), you should go with a more specific datatype\n",
    "    - One good reason to use VARCHAR is to avoid type-specific errors during importation of the data...which will LIKELY happen for data that is not 100% clean (which is always the case)!!!!!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.

    "- __Proper Terminology of SQL__\n",
    "    - According to [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/files/documentation/pdf/12/postgresql-12-US.pdf), the list of columns to be selected is a \"__Select List__\", and the table name in the FROM section is called a \"__Table Expression__\". To avoid confusion, we will use more intuitive terms such as \"list of columns\" and \"table name\", respectively.<br><br>\n",
    "- __How to Comment in SQL__ \n",
    "    - If you haven't figured it out, a double dash ('--') adds a comment into the query. \n",
    "        - In MySQL, it's `/* comments */`, with _both_ ends of the comment designation required.\n",
    "    - As any programmer will tell you, __COMMENTING IS KEY. COMMENTING IS reQUIRED.__ <br><br>\n",
    "- __How to Format SQL Code__\n",
    "    - The line breaks, capitalization, spacing, and indentation of the query is __ALL__ stylistic - it won't cause an error during compilation if you ignore these things (you can even do the above query all in one line!). The purpose of all these things is for ease of reading.\n",
    "        - The indentation and formatting presented here is typical SQL formatting (well..._I_ like to think it's pretty legit...).\n",
    "        - The optional capitalization also applies to names of things to which you are referring as well as the SQL commands.\n",
    "    - The terminal semicolon is also a relic adopted from other programming languages to signal the end of the query. Echoing the previous bullet, it is optional.\n",

    "Using __`SELECT`__ is often the first thing you want to do. You \"select\" which columns you would like to output from the query, with each column separated by a comma (listing \"things\" in a series in SQL requires commas, or else you'll get an error!). \n",
    "- __The order of the SELECT is important!!!__ What is outputted is a table with the columns in the order in which you listed.\n",
    "- If you want to select the entire dataset, you use a asterisk (\\*), such as `SELECT * FROM datatable1`. \n",

    "\n",
    "__Aggregation__ is a fancy word for combining all values in a column, and picking a ___single___ value from that grouping, whether it be the maximum value of the group, the average value of the group, the number count of values of the total group, sum, median, etc. <br>\n",

    "Because aggregating things results in a single aggregated value, we need to create a __`GROUP BY`__ section to yield a full table. For example, SELECT MAX(weight) FROM vehicles will give one value: the maximum weight listed in the entire vehicles table. The moment we select something else, such as SELECT vehicle_type, MAX(weight) FROM vehicles, SQL won't know how to reconcile a single value column with a column of rows of different types of vehicle values spanning the entire length of the vehicles dataset. By doing SELECT vehicle_type, MAX(weight) FROM vehicles GROUP BY vehicle_type, SQL now knows to output a table of the maximum weight of the vehicle in _each_ vehicle type category. \n",

    "Based on this methodology, there are __TWO AGGREGATION RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED:__\n",
