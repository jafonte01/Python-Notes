    "### Importing Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the raw way of importing files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import my_file`\n",
    "    - _Not_ `import 'my_file'`\n",
    "    - _Not_ `import my_file.py`\n",

    "The following is a list of mutability of objects:\n",

    "__Mutable:__\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "    - Keys are _not_ returned in the order they were inserted (you can insert one into position 3 of a 10 length dictionary).\n",
    "- Lists\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of Python functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions _can_ be defined within another function (\"Function Nesting\").\n",
    "- Functions do _not_ require a \"return\" statement. Functions can have zero or more return statements.\n",
    "- If and for statements do not _always_ require indentation (e.g., they can be part of a one-line list comprehension).\n",
    "- Keyword arguments are _not_ the same as default parameter values. This is more of an academic distinction, but correct terminology is nonetheless important.\n",
    "    - for a function `def func(a=1, b=2, c=3): pass`: \n",
    "        - a, b, and c are the default parameter/argument values. If you did func(), it would readily assume the default values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "        - Conversely, keyword arguments are _called_ - they are not the default. This allows for out-of-order calls too, like func(c=100, a=12, b=20). If \"b\" wasn't passed as an argument, again, it would assume the default value of b=2.\n",
    "- Breaks in a function are used to stop and exit from executing _only_ the enclosed loop in which the \"break\" resides.\n",

    "### Global vs. Local Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Global__ means outside of a function, i.e., applies globally. __Local__ means defined and used only in a specific context, such as only within a function.\n",
    "- For example, \"global built-in functions\" are list, sum, and other basic Python built-in functionality that can be used both inside and outside functions.\n",
    "    - Global built-in functions _can_ be redefined (e.g., `list = 'alfie'` making `list(0,1,2,3)` broken), but that is ill-advised.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- The __LEGB Rule__ identifies the order in which Python searches a variable for use:\n",
    "    - __(L)__ _Local_: Inside a function or class. If the variable is not found there, it will look to \n",
    "    - __(E)__ _Enclosed_: Outside portions of the function (not local to the specific indented level of the function).\n",
    "    - __(G)__ _Global_: If not in a function, will look to global variables. That's why list = alfie changes list before\n",
    "    - __(B)__ _Built-in_: If not defined globally, will look to built-in functionality for variable's purpose.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - Storing local variables are __faster__ to lookup than global variables. _Why?_ The bytecode uses a `STORE_FAST` action instead of the global variable's `STORE_NAME` action. Why this is the case just comes down to convention (based on my research).\n",
