    "Data requests are not directly made to a target website, and the target website's response is sent directly back to you; it is not like there is a dedicated line between your terminal and the target website's server. The internet would be immediately overloaded if that were the case. Instead, requests are made much more indirectly...\n",

    "\n",
    "Data is transferred as information __IP packets___, taking a variable path to the destination server, depending on a particular path's congestion, location, general speed of the wires, and the size of the packet. At every connection, the packet is re-routed via a __router__ to get it closer to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, information packets are too large to send at once, especially media data. Sending one picture for example would require the internet to break up the billions of bits into multiple smaller packets, which do not arrive at the destination all at the same time (and may not even arrive in order). The specifics of how this works is described in section C.2. below. How the Internet ensures that all packets are sent is described in section C.3. below.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. _Establishing a Connection with the Next Node_: TCP uses a \"__Three-Way Handshake__\" to confirm between nodes that a connection is established:\n",

One by one, the receiving node sends an ACK back for each received packet.\n",
    "    - If no ACK message is sent back after a certain period of time, the sending node will automatically send the same packet again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _Notifying Termination of Transmission_: When the transmission is complete (or is cancelled or otherwise terminated), the sending node sends a \"Finish\" (\"FIN\") message. The receiving node will send an ACK FIN message back, with a final confirming ACK message from the sending node to the receiving node. Once this happens, the connection is closed.\n",

    "### TLS Step-By-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Three-way handshake is established between sending (\"client\") and receiving (\"server\") nodes.\n",
    "2. After three-way handshake, the client sends a message requesting that a TLS connection is made instead of a standard insecure connection.\n",
    "3. The server sends back a __Digital Certificate__ containing its public key. The client verifies the certificate as valid before further action.\n",
    "    - If the server does not support TLS Protocol, it will abort the connection.\n",
    "    - If the client is unable to verify the certificate, it will abort the connection. This can happen if a client is re-routed to a phishing website.\n",
    "4. To avoid requiring both the client and server to expend computational power to create their own private keys, the client sends a message encrypted with the server's public key. In the encrypted transmission is a \"__pre-master key__\", which is a shared secret key between the client and the server. The pre-master key is transferred under the server's public key encryption.\n",
    "    - This would be a risk without digital certificate verification, as you would essentially be sending the wrong person the method of decrypting the information. __The digital certificate is what makes TLS possible.__\n",
    "5. The server decrypts the message with its own private key, thus decrypting the pre-master key in that message. The decrypted pre-master key is the _master key_.\n",
    "    - Sometimes, part of step 5 is the server first verifying the client's digital certificate, if required by the server.\n",
    "6. The server sends a confirmation to the client encrypted in the shared master key. The client decrypts the confirmation message with the master key decryption.\n",
    "    - Both the client and the server have saved computational power by engaging in symmetric encryption from this point on.\n",
    "7. The remainder of the transmissions is done by both the client and server encrypting and decrypting the data with the master key. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Importing/Reading and Exporting/Writing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the raw way of importing files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import my_file`\n",
    "    - _Not_ `import 'my_file'`\n",
    "    - _Not_ `import my_file.py`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Python will _not_ search other subdirectories for the named file if Python cannot find the named file at the named location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exporting/Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "- When writing something to a file, _everything_, including numbers, must be first converted to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of mutability of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Mutable:__\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "    - Keys are _not_ returned in the order they were inserted (you can insert one into position 3 of a 10 length dictionary).\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "    - Same idea for no order if you insert list item into the middle of a list.\n",
    "\n",

    "__Immutable:__\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of Python functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions _can_ be defined within another function (\"Function Nesting\").\n",
    "- Functions do _not_ require a \"return\" statement. Functions can have zero or more return statements.\n",
    "- If and for statements do not _always_ require indentation (e.g., they can be part of a one-line list comprehension).\n",
    "- Keyword arguments are _not_ the same as default parameter values. This is more of an academic distinction, but correct terminology is nonetheless important.\n",
    "    - for a function `def func(a=1, b=2, c=3): pass`: \n",
    "        - a, b, and c are the default parameter/argument values. If you did func(), it would readily assume the default values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "        - Conversely, keyword arguments are _called_ - they are not the default. This allows for out-of-order calls too, like func(c=100, a=12, b=20). If \"b\" wasn't passed as an argument, again, it would assume the default value of b=2.\n",
    "- Breaks in a function are used to stop and exit from executing _only_ the enclosed loop in which the \"break\" resides.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Global vs. Local Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Global__ means outside of a function, i.e., applies globally. __Local__ means defined and used only in a specific context, such as only within a function.\n",
    "- For example, \"global built-in functions\" are list, sum, and other basic Python built-in functionality that can be used both inside and outside functions.\n",
    "    - Global built-in functions _can_ be redefined (e.g., `list = 'alfie'` making `list(0,1,2,3)` broken), but that is ill-advised.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- The __LEGB Rule__ identifies the order in which Python searches a variable for use:\n",
    "    - __(L)__ _Local_: Inside a function or class. If the variable is not found there, it will look to \n",
    "    - __(E)__ _Enclosed_: Outside portions of the function (not local to the specific indented level of the function).\n",
    "    - __(G)__ _Global_: If not in a function, will look to global variables. That's why list = alfie changes list before\n",
    "    - __(B)__ _Built-in_: If not defined globally, will look to built-in functionality for variable's purpose.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - Storing local variables are __faster__ to lookup than global variables. _Why?_ The bytecode uses a `STORE_FAST` action instead of the global variable's `STORE_NAME` action. Why this is the case just comes down to convention (based on my research).\n",
