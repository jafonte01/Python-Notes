    "### Importing Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the raw way of importing files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import my_file`\n",
    "    - _Not_ `import 'my_file'`\n",
    "    - _Not_ `import my_file.py`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Python will _not_ search other subdirectories for the named file if Python cannot find the named file at the named location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exporting/Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "- When writing something to a file, _everything_ including numbers, must be first converted to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of mutability of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Mutable:__\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "    - Keys are _not_ returned in the order they were inserted (you can insert one into position 3 of a 10 length dictionary).\n",
    "- Lists\n",

    "Parameters of Python functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions _can_ be defined within another function (\"Function Nesting\").\n",
    "- Functions do _not_ require a \"return\" statement. Functions can have zero or more return statements.\n",
    "- If and for statements do not _always_ require indentation (e.g., they can be part of a one-line list comprehension).\n",
    "- Keyword arguments are _not_ the same as default parameter values.\n",
    "    - a  \n",
    "- Breaks in a function are used to stop and exit from executing _only_ the enclosed loop in which the \"break\" resides.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Global vs. Local Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Global__ means outside of a function, i.e., applies globally. __Local__ means defined and used only in a specific context, such as only within a function.\n",
    "- For example, \"global built-in functions\" are list, sum, and other basic Python built-in functionality that can be used both inside and outside functions.\n",
    "    - Global built-in functions _can_ be redefined (e.g., `list = 'alfie'` making `list(0,1,2,3)` broken), but that is ill-advised.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- The __LEGB Rule__ identifies the order in which Python searches a variable for use:\n",
    "    - __(L)__ _Local_: Inside a function or class. If the variable is not found there, it will look to \n",
    "    - __(E)__ _Enclosed_: Outside portions of the function (not local to the specific indented level of the function).\n",
    "    - __(G)__ _Global_: If not in a function, will look to global variables. That's why list = alfie changes list before\n",
    "    - __(B)__ _Built-in_: If not defined globally, will look to built-in functionality for variable's purpose.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - Storing local variables are __faster__ to lookup than global variables. _Why?_ The bytecode uses a `STORE_FAST` action instead of the global variable's `STORE_NAME` action. Why this is the case just comes down to convention (based on my research).\n",

To get into command mode, press either the `Esc` key or mouse click on the white space between the colored line and the cell. Once the line turns blue and you are in command mode, you can use any of the following hotkeys to manipulate Jupyter cells. A complete list of hotkeys can be found in the _Command Palette_ at the top of the Jupyter toolbar.\n",

    "- To access command mode of multiple cells at one time. `Shift` + up or down arrow keys.<br>\n",
    "    - This only allows you to access _consecutive_ multiple cells. You would have to change the order of the cells first before moving non-consecutive cells. This can be down by clicking the up or down arrows on the Jupyter toolbar (no hotkeys for those :/)<br><br>\n",

This error states that you have (at least) one too many variables not assigned by an equal sign (a \"positional argument\") _after_ the keyword argument, and so python doesn't know what to do with it. For example: `my_funct(x, y, z=111)` --> (calling) `my_func(x=1, y=22, z=44, 132)`. In short, you probably forgot a comma or an equal sign --> check your syntax m8.\n",
