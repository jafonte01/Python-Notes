    "<br><br>\n",
    "__To use a hotkey, one must be in _command mode___. If the cell is green on the left-hand side of the cell, it is not in command mode, which is in blue. To get into command mode, press either the `Esc` key or mouse click on the white space between the colored line and the cell. Once the line turns blue and you are in command mode, you can use any of the following hotkeys to manipulate Jupyter cells. A complete list of hotkeys can be found in the _Command Palette_ at the top of the Jupyter toolbar.\n",
    "- To delete a cell..................................... `d` key twice <br><br>\n",
    "- To undo cell deletion................................ `z` key<br><br>\n",
    "- To create a new cell above........................... `a` key (`b` key for new cell below)<br><br>\n",
    "- To convert a cell to HTML markup..................... `m` key (`y` key for coding cell)<br><br>\n",
    "- To cut and paste cells............................... `x` and `v` keys, respectively (`c` for copy)<br><br>\n",
    "- To access command mode of multiple cells at one time. `Shift` + up or down arrow keys.<br>\n",
    "    - This only allows you to access _consecutive_ multiple cells. You would have to change the order of the cells first before moving non-consecutive cells. This can be down by clicking the up or down arrows on the Jupyter toolbar (no hotkeys for those :/)<br><br>\n",
    "- To compile and run a cell............................. `Shift + Enter` keys (will move to next cell; do `Ctrl + Enter` if you want to stay on same cell)<br><br>\n",

This error states that you have (at least) one too many variables not assigned by an equal sign (a \"positional argument\") _after_ the keyword argument, and so python doesn't know what to do with it. For example: `my_funct(x, y, z=111)` --> (calling) `my_func(x=1, y=22, z=44, 132)`. In short, you probably forgot a comma or an equal sign --> check your syntax m8.\n",
