    "\n",
    "1. __HOTKEYS__ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are hotkeys used within Jupyter for cell manipulation. Instead of compiling an entire page, one can run a single block (_cell_) of code at a time.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "__To use a hotkey, one must be in _command mode___. If the cell is green on the left-hand side of the cell, it is not in command mode, which is in blue. To get into command mode, press either the `Esc` key or mouse click on the white space between the colored line and the cell. Once the line turns blue and you are in command mode, you can use any of the following hotkeys to manipulate Jupyter cells. A complete list of hotkeys can be found in the _Command Palette_ at the top of the Jupyter toolbar.\n",
    "- To delete a cell..................................... `d` key twice <br><br>\n",
    "- To undo cell deletion................................ `z` key<br><br>\n",
    "- To create a new cell above........................... `a` key (`b` key for new cell below)<br><br>\n",
    "- To convert a cell to HTML markup..................... `m` key (`y` key for coding cell)<br><br>\n",
    "- To cut and paste cells............................... `x` and `v` keys, respectively (`c` for copy)<br><br>\n",
    "- To access command mode of multiple cells at one time. `Shift` + up or down arrow keys.<br>\n",
    "    - This only allows you to access _consecutive_ multiple cells. You would have to change the order of the cells first before moving non-consecutive cells. This can be down by clicking the up or down arrows on the Jupyter toolbar (no hotkeys for those :/)<br><br>\n",
    "- To compile and run a cell............................. `Shift + Enter` keys (will move to next cell; do `Ctrl + Enter` if you want to stay on same cell)<br><br>\n",
    "- To toggle (hide/show) cell output..................... `O` key, or double click on the output with mouse.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "__Answer:__ This occurs when the kernel died and reset, but your notebook is still up and you are working on the notebook from the same dead kernel. Open a _separate notebook_ from the port, which will \"re-activate\" the kernel, and you will be able to save the notebook no problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Python-Specific Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "`object is not subscriptable` <br>\n",
    "__Answer:__ replace brackets with parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "`EOF Parsing error` <br>\n",
    "__Answer:__ Missing a parenthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "`Truth-value of a series is ambiguous` <br>\n",
    "__Answer:__ Python refuses to check the truth-value of things with more than one value (lists, tuples, pandas series, etc.). Do a list comprehension where the conditional can be applied to every individual datapoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ValueError: Too many values to unpack (or not enough values to unpack)` <br>\n",
    "__Answer:__ You set too many variables but did not give enough values (or the opposite - too many values but not enough variables to assign). This is a common mistake when zipping several variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ValueError: Setting an array element with a sequence`<br>\n",
    "__Answer:__ When comparing elements within an array, the lengths of those elements _must be the identical length_. An irregular length, such as np.array(\\[1,2\\], \\[1,4,5,6\\], \\[11\\]) will trigger this error - you would have to make the second element smaller to length of 2 to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SyntaxError: Positional Argument follows keyword argument`<br>\n",
    "__Answer:__ Keyword argument is a variable with default setting identified by equal sign (usually found in function calls, param1=122). This error states that you have (at least) one too many variables not assigned by an equal sign (a \"positional argument\") _after_ the keyword argument, and so python doesn't know what to do with it. For example: `my_funct(x, y, z=111)` --> (calling) `my_func(x=1, y=22, z=44, 132)`. In short, you probably forgot a comma or an equal sign --> check your syntax m8.\n",
    "\n",
    "`EOF when reading a line.` (_input error_) <br>\n",
    "__Answer:__ This shows that the compiler is performing a function before breaking. In other words, it uses up all the input it has then throws an error saying it doesn't know what to do because all the input was used up but the function wants it to keep going.\n",
    "\n",
