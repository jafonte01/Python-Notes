    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**ABM**</u> (*Business Term/Program*)</span>\n",
    "    - A marketing term that stands for \"Account-Based Marketing\".\n",
    "    - ABM is the strategic analysis of whether a company should focus its efforts on targeting quality leads, as opposed to a sheer volume approach.\n",
    "    - ***See also*** other marketing terms, such as \"GTM\" and \"TAM (& SAM & SOM)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**\"Above the Fold\"**</u> (*Business Term/Program*)</span>\n",
    "    - This term refers to the section of a webpage that a user sees when s/he visits a website. \n",
    "    - Anything involving clicking into things or scrolling down the webpage would be the opposite of above the fold (i.e., ***\"Below the Fold\"***).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Abstraction**</u> (*Computer Science // Mathematics*)</span>\n",
    "    - An intentional simplification of an actual system for purposes of turning focus to a higher-level concept.\n",
    "    - For example, \"0\" and \"1\" representing \"off\" and \"on\" is an abstraction for how circuits work. In actuality, transistors have threshold voltages that may differ between computers, but having to explain bits with certain voltage ranges results in immediate overcomplication.\n",
    "    - Another example is logic gates symbols being an abstraction for what the circuitry actually is like, and how lines for a hardware schematic are an abstraction for more detailed connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**A/B Testing**</u> (*Data Analysis/Data Science*)</span>\n",
    "    - A/B testing refers to analyzing the success and usage of two different versions of a program or webpage. Group \"A\" would receive or see one version, and Group \"B\" would receive or see the other version.\n",
    "    - This method of experimentation does not necessarily need to be exactly two versions. That is why this term is sometimes referred to as \"A/B/n Testing\".\n",
    "    - This is different than ***A/A Testing***, where the same group of users interacts with the same program or webpage after a certain period of time. In theory, nothing should change; A/A testing is used to validate a program or webpage in this fashion, and to identify & examine any changes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Account Based Marketing**</u> (*Business Term/Program*)</span>\n",
    "    - A business marketing strategy that concentrates the business's resources on a certain target set of accounts within a market.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**ACID \\[Compliance\\]**</u> (*Computer Science // DevOps*)</span>\n",
    "    - For data consistency in transactions, it must satisfy ***ACID*** properties before the transaction can be considered completed. While considered only a single operation, \"ACID\" is an acronym for four separate properties that must be satisfied:\n",
    "        - *Atomicity*: Every data element is considered its own transaction. If one transaction fails, the whole transaction fails, and the database is left unchanged.\n",
    "        - *Consistency*: The change to a database must satisfy all constraints, rules, and triggers.\n",
    "        - *Isolation*: A type of concurrency check - if transactions are executed concurrently (they often are), the concurrent execution must achieve the same result as if the transactions were executed sequentially.\n",
    "        - *Durability*: After a transaction is completed, it remains committed to memory (i.e., it is stored in non-volatile memory).\n",
    "    - ***See*** \"Data Consistency\" and \"Data Transactions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**ACL**</u> (*Computer Science // Networking & IT // Database*)</span>\n",
    "    - Stands for \"Active Control List\". \n",
    "    - An ACL is a list of rules that govern when to grant or deny access to an environment.\n",
    "        - For example, a ***filesystem ACL*** sets the permissions of users for access to a given computing system.\n",
    "        - This is contrasted with a ***networking ACL***, which sets the permissions of who can access the network (like who can get onto a WiFi router).\n",
    "        - A more granular version of an ACL is a ***Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)***, where an administrator can set permissions to users within an organization based on a given \"role\" of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Active-Active Data Centers**</u> (*Database*)</span>\n",
    "    - The use of at least two data servers for servicing an application at any time. The redundancy is intentional to maintain the application even if one of the servers goes down (ensuring a desired level of ***high availability***).\n",
    "        - One of the servers is the main server, with the others being ***read replicas*** of the main server. The replicas are used as backups until the main server is back up and running.\n",
    "            - AWS's database architectures quite often incorporate this redundant architecture.\n",
    "    - More generally known as an \"active-active architecture\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Active Directory**</u> (*DevOps // Networking & IT*)</span>\n",
    "    - It is a proprietary directory service by Microsoft, which authenticates and authorizes all users/computers of a certain domain type within a network.\n",
    "    - In layman's terms, it is the software that would check user login info against the information within the domain type network.\n",
    "    - The proprietary software acts as a framework for deploying related services too.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Agent-Based Model (ABM)**</u> (*Programming Concept*)</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Agile**</u> (*DevOps*)</span>\n",
    "    - Agile development is a ***project management methodology***: it is a framework of how a project should proceed from start to finish.\n",
    "    - Agile development focuses on concurrent task work, with review and iteration of previous stages of the development life cycle. \n",
    "    - Agile is contrasted with other forms of project management methodology, such as Waterfall.\n",
    " \n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#D2691E\"> Which Project Management Methodology Should I Choose?</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key factors to consider when choosing a PM methodology are: \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Flexibility** of deadlines and general project path\n",
    "- Level of **Clarity** of project path (and the project's requirements)\n",
    "- Practical constraints such as **budget** (i.e., the \"need to eliminate waste)\n",

    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Ajax**</u> (*Programming Language/Library*)</span>\n",
    "    - Portmanteau of \"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\".\n",
    "    - Ajax is a type of coding (Wikipedia refers to it as \"a set of web development techniques\") that allows for asynchronous web applications, i.e., sending and retrieving data between the application and the server in an asynchronous manner that results in changing the state of the application without interfering with the display or behavior of the webpage.\n",
    "    - More commonly today, JSON is used instead of XML, but the idea is the same.\n",

    "        - Examples of such key metrics include: response time, error rate, and throughput.\n",
    "        - \"AppDynamics\" - defined immediately below - is an example of an APM company.\n",
    "        - Another name for APM is ***IT Operations Analytics (\"ITOA\")***. ITOA is a more general term pertaining to retrieving and reporting data for IT operations, rather than specific functionality issues such as in APM.\n",
    "    - APM is an acronym for many other things in the tech space, including Active Policy Management or Actions per Minute in the real-time strategy game space.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Application**</u> (*DevOps*)</span>\n",
    "    - The term \"application\" merely means a program that can be used by a user (as opposed to an automated program).\n",
    "        - In this sense, the term \"application\" is more widely used than the term \"program\", as the \"programs\" that are being referred to are almost always ones that are being used.\n",
    "    - Commonly referred to as \"app\" for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Application Programming Interface (\"API\")**</u> (*DevOps // Networking & IT // Interface/IDE*)</span>\n",
    "    - In layman’s terms, an API is a gateway in which two systems respond to each other - one system sends information, the API interprets and routes the information, and the second system receives the information. This is akin to a waiter (API) moving a food order (the information) between the patrons (sender) and the kitchen (receiver).\n",
    "    - A good overview of API's is [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTSQjw5DrM&list=WL&index=34).\n",
    "    - There are two main types of API protocols:<br>\n",
    "        1. ***REST*** - Stands for \"REpresentational State Transfer\" \\[Protocol\\].\n",
    "            - REST sets constraints in  which data can pass through the API between two (or more) systems within a network.\n",
    "            - When a web API can accommodate a REST framework (i.e., obeys the constraints of REST), it is said to be ***RESTful***.\n",
    "                - Likewise, a RESTful/user-friendly website is said to have a ***Clean URL***.\n",
    "            - REST is newer and more widely used than SOAP (see below).\n",
    "            - A REST API call contains four (4) main pieces (for web API's using HTTP):\n",
    "                - *Endpoint*: The URL of the API to which the user seeks to obtain or post data.\n",
    "                    - A URL is for web API's. A more general term for an endpoint is a ***URI*** (\"Uniform Resource Identifier\").\n",
    "                - *Content/Headers*: The specific syntax of the API call. It can be set to \"application/JSON\"; \"xml-encoded\", \"xxx-www-URL-encoded\", or others.\n",
    "                - *Method*: The exact action to be taken with the API call. There are only four different kinds of methods within HTTP:\n",
    "                    - a. GET - Request and pull information from the endpoint network.\n",
    "                        - (This is laymen's terms. More accurately it is defined as \"Get a representation of the target resource's state\").\n",
    "                    - b. POST - Add and/or update information to the endpoint network\n",
    "                        - (\"Let the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request\").\n",
    "                    - c. PUT - A combination of POST and DELETE - it is a replacement of data on the endpoint network.\n",
    "                        - (\"Create or replace the state of the target resource with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request\").\n",
    "                    - d. DELETE - Outright delete the target resource. Obviously used quite rarely.\n",
    "                - *Body*: The actual data, set to whatever syntax and formatting identified by the header. If the header is not identified, an error will be thrown.<br><br>\n",
    "        2. ***SOAP*** - Stands for \"Simple Object Access Protocol\".\n",
    "            - Unlike REST, there is an official standard for SOAP, including that it only uses XML formatting.\n",
    "                - For this reason, a header does not need to be identified.\n",
    "            - SOAP is older than REST but is still used, especially when interacting with older software.\n",
    "            - One major benefit to SOAP over REST is that it is protocol agnostic; it can run across programming models, including between differing operating systems, and use any protocol (HTTP, SMTP, and TCP).\n",
    "            - There are only two (2) required pieces to a SOAP call:\n",
    "                - a. *Envelope*: Identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.\n",
    "                - b. *Body*: Contains call ***and*** response information.\n",

However, with a mask, we can store all 8 boolean values in a single byte.\n",
    "        - ***Bitshifting***: A specific kind of bitwise operation that shifts all digits of a bit array to the left or right. In doing so - because bit arrays are of a specific finite length (often, a byte at a time), one or more bits may be \"shifted out\" of the register and that many new bits \"shifted in\" to that register.\n",
    "            - The resulting value depends on the system's ***endian-ness*** (the orientation of bit reading - left-to-right or right-to-left? (***see*** \"Endian-ness\")).\n",
    "            - There are many kinds of bit shifts. Here are some examples:\n",
    "                - *Arithmetic Shift*: The bit(s) that are shifted out of the register are discarded. The sign bit (see above), is retained, however.\n",
    "                - *Logical Shift*: Same as arithmetic shift, but discards the shifted-out bit regardless of the sign bit.\n",
    "                - *Circular Shift*: Shifts the shifted-out bit to the beginning location of the shift. Depending on the kind of circular shift, it can change the value of the C-Flag or ignore it entirely (see above for \"Carry Flag\").\n",

When data is cached in multiple locations, so that multiple functions can retrieve the cached data for processing, the output may be different if the functions are different. Therefore, it is important to update the value of the cache for *all* cache locations, so that the values are the same when doing multiple processes (i.e., the values are \"coherent\" across caches).

    "            - When a network partition failure happens, the network must decide whether to cancel the operation (decreasing availability but maintaining consistency), or to proceed with the operation (increasing availability but risking inconsistency).\n",
    "            - No distributed system is safe from network failures, making networking partitioning a requirement. Therefore, the \"two out of three\" language is a little misleading - more accurately, a distributed data store must be partition tolerant and must choose between consistency or availability of data.\n",

    "    - A confidence interval is a range in which a specific data point lies.\n",
    "    - Sometimes, an exact value is known for a data point. In that case, an interval or range is not needed - the value is the value. However, exact values cannot be 100% confidently identified when making inferences from a sample to a population. Thus, such data points would come with a range bar identifying that the actual population value of a data point is within a range of values based on a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "        - For example, saying that a data point has a value of \"1.5 to 1.7 with a 95% confidence interval\" means: \"I am 95% confident that the *actual* value for this data point is within the range 1.5 to 1.7.\"\n",
    "            - The larger the interval, the larger the confidence. To use an analogy: if a fisherman will throw his net (his confidence interval) over a specific area of water (the outcome variable data space) to catch fish (the *actual* outcome variable value), he is implicitly saying that he is confident to a certain degree that a fish caught is *somewhere* within the range of the length of the net.\n",
    "                - Now, of course, the fisherman can catch a wider net - and thus have higher confidence that fish will be caught - but that will not help the fisherman in the future in finding fish. The fisherman is 100% confident that he will catch fish if he threw a net the size of the ocean into the water, but the increase in the confidence interval gives us less meaningful data as to where the fish actually are!\n",
    "            - The percentage of confidence is called the ***confidence level***. Because statistics works with the \"null\" as the default, more correctly, the confidence level is not measured by a percentage but rather an ***alpha value***, which is (1 - (confidence level)). So, an alpha of 0.05 (i.e., 95% confidence level) says: \"if this experiment were repeated 20 times, approximately 1 of those times will yield a value outside of the confidence interval\".\n",
    "    - The concept of confidence intervals is directly related to the ***margin of error***. A margin of error is the amount of an observed value from which the true value lies. Saying \"1.5 +/- 0.2\" means that the value *could* be anywhere between 1.7 and 1.3.\n",
    "        - In this respect, **the confidence interval is twice the margin of error**. The former is just identifying the *interval* only (with a declared confidence percentage), and the other is a range of error qualifying a *defined value*.\n",
    "    - A confidence interval is calculated based on a z-value (***see*** \"Z-Score\").\n",

[Studies show](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8896957) that the Kappa coefficient does not make sense outside of this context - and even in the context - is only a viable metric when there is a balanced dataset (no bias or prevalence). For that reason, [studies suggest](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222916) that Kappa should be eliminated from the realm of performance metrics altogether, especially when there are so many viable alternatives.\n",

    "        - **Relational Model (RM)**: Data is organized into tuples, which a user can declare which data goes where, and where the data is \"in relation to\" other data.\n",
    "            - By formal definition, a ***relation*** is a set of tuples (each one being a *row* of data) containing data elements of differing *atrributes* (columns), thus forming a table. The resulting table is the \"relation\".\n",
    "                - Fun fact: a relational model is not called \"Relational\" because of the connections between tables. Rather, a relational database is \"relational\" because it utilizes relational algebra (cartesian products, set theory formulae, etc.). The practical distinction between this and its more colloquial usage is non-existent.\n",
    "            - Relational models are the most common, as SQL can often traverse this model with ease.\n",
    "            - However, relational models may not be appropriate for certain kinds of data, such as ones with various one-to-many and many-to-one lookups and ones with many necessary connections. See below.\n",
    "                - Moreover, a relational model inherently needs a schema, and if you don't know the connections between tables, and/or if you don't know where certain data is found, you can be at a significant loss.\n",
    "             - Relational models must be ACID compliant (***see*** \"ACID\"), which makes this database model much more difficult to scale.\n",
    "                 - There are now relational databases that specifically address the inherent scaling issue (e.g., ***Cockroach***).<br><br>\n",
    "        - **Object(-Oriented) Model (OOM)**: Each table is its own \"object\", and rows of data underneath the table are individual instances of that object. Examples are as follows:\n",
    "            - A *key-value model* where a key is the identifier and the value is the data. \n",
    "                - Fast, but very limited in architecture. Data is often stored in RAM, making this model alternatively called an \"In-Memory Database\".\n",
    "                - ***See*** \"redis\".\n",
    "            - A *wide-column key-value model* is the same as the previous model, but the \"value\" is an object containing more than one piece of information (think of a JSON object with arrays and discrete pieces of data that may be of different data types). \n",
    "                - It is faster than a relational database since it is decentralized and schema-less, but because of this, the data may not be as organized as intuitively as a relational database (and there are no \"joins\" of any sorts as a result). \n",
    "                - Because it is decentralized, it is faster to scale up and replicate than a relational model (i.e., good for high-write/low-read data, like historical records).\n",
    "                - ***See*** \"Cassandra\" and \"HBase\".<br><br> \n",
    "        - **Object-Oriented Relational Model (OORM)**: A combination of the above two - the data is stored as separate objects, but these objects can be accessed relationally, which allows for querying and data manipulation. Examples are as follows:\n",
    "            - A *document-oriented database* is a double grouping of objects. Each object is a \"document\" - a JSON containing multiple key-value pairs, and multiple documents are grouped as a \"collection\" object.\n",
    "                - There is an indexing of collections and can be organized into a logical hierarchy, but it is not truly a relational model since there are no lookups or joins.\n",
    "                - Good for data that doesn't really need a specific schema, as it is faster than a relational model. However, if the data needs to be connected in various ways, a document-oriented database would not suffice - a document is a microcosm of data in that respect - only the collections are related.\n",
    "                - ***See*** MongoDB, Firestore, DynamoDB, and CouchDB as document-oriented database examples. <br><br>\n",
    "            - A *graph database* model is one where data is stored as *nodes* and are related by *edges*. For example, a reviews database may have a \"user_23\" node with \"post_a\" and \"post_b\" as nodes that are connected to it, with each edge connection being identified as \":author\" (of the posts).\n",
    "                - This is great for one-to-many and many-to-one lookups, as well as more convoluted connections between data (whereas, for a relational model, joins of intermediary tables may be necessary to establish the connections between the relevant data).\n",
    "                    - For this reason, graph databases are great for recommendation engines and other search-all engines.\n",
    "                - ***See*** neo4j, TigerGraph, JanusGraph, AWS Neptune, and Dgraph as graph database examples.\n",
    "            <br><br>\n",
    "            - A *search engine* database (a/k/a \"full text database\") takes advantage of the great connectability of a graph database, without using a node-and-edge architecture.\n",
    "                - A search engine database uses documents as objects (see above), and then creates an *inverted index* of all data in the entire database, identifying the keys of all documents for where each item of data is stored. \n",
    "                - From there, the query is based on the index, not the entire database, making the search lookup much faster.\n",
    "                    - Additionally, the database can accommodate algorithms for ranking, typo handling in searches, and other use cases.\n",
    "                - The benefit to a search engine database is that they are incredibly fast for a large dataset, but they come with a ton of cost and overhead, especially when scaled.\n",

    "        - MVC is a model where three components of a website are completely separated; changes to one do not affect the other two components. The structure of MVC is as follows:\n",
    "            - *Model:* The object that is being presented. *Example:* An HTML form on a webpage.\n",
    "            - *View:* Something that is able to \"see\" the model. *Example:* a web browser that renders the webpage with the form.\n",
    "            - *Controller:* The mechanisms that are triggered when the model is manipulated, along with how the model accepts the initial inputs. *Example:* functions that handle form data when it is submitted.\n",
    "        - A ***Hierarchical Model-View-Controller (HMVC)*** is when the controller accepts subroutines and manipulates the Model *before* the Controller gives the View access to the Model. This is used when changes are made inline, such as when a comment is posted on a webpage without having to reload the webpage in its entirety (i.e., for a traditional MVC, it would have to do a second HTTP GET request). \n",
    "        - For MVVM, instead of a controller dictating the state of the Model, a \"ViewModel\" binds communications from the View to the state of the data in the Model, which changes the View in turn.\n",
    "    - A variant of MVC is ***Model-View-Presenter (MVP)***, where the Presenter (controller) modifies the Model itself. One example is a relational data table - a presenter would retrieve data and output it to a new query output table.\n",
    "        - The difference between MVP and MVVM is that the Presenter merely works with the Model separate from the View, whereas in MVVM, the View directly binds to properties of the ViewModel to send and receive updates.\n",
    "    - Another variant is ***Model-View-Adapter (MVA)***, where the Adapter modifies the View for the user, but in reality, it is retaining the original shape and state of the model. This is good for when a model should not be configurable.\n",
    "        - Given the middle-man nature of the Adapter between the View and the Model in this design, the design is alternatively called a \"mediating-controller MVC\".\n",
    "    - A final variant example of MVC is the ***Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC)***. Here, the abstraction is the Model and the processing of the data therein; the Presentation is the View, and the Control is the functionality controlling the flow and communication between the other two components.\n",
    "        - The difference between PAC and MVC is that PAC is hierarchical, making there be zero communication between Presentation and Abstraction (whereas MVC has interconnectivity between all three components on some level). In doing so, this allows the GUI/Presentation to be shown before the Abstraction has even fully initialized.\n",

These iterations are sometimes done bidirectionally so that future iterations are done with properly updated neurons. The exact amount of connections, how the weights are assigned, where the processed data goes, and the activation function for the neurons all depends on the specific architecture of the neural network.\n",

    "    - Types of neural networks:\n",
    "        - ***Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)***: Unidirectional propagation where the neurons of the network process parts of the data in relation to each other, to form (\"pool\") the image (the convolutional layer) and process it (\"convert\" and then \"flatten\". After one or more convolutional layers, the processed data is fed into a regular neural network for classification. Great for computer vision.\n",
    "            - Image generators, instead of image analyzers, is essentially the reverse process. Neural networks that do this are thus called \"Deconvolutional Neural Networks\".\n",
    "        - ***Deep Neural Network (DNN)***: An unofficial general term for a neural network that has multiple layers between the input and output layers.\n",
    "        - ***Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)***: a deconvolutional neural network called a \"generator\" is trained to produce images that are similar to the dataset. Then, the \"discriminative\" neural network reviews the dataset, which now includes newly produced images, to see which ones are the synthesized ones. Due to backpropagation, the generator learns from the discriminator and makes images that are closer to the training data images, and in forward propagation, the discriminator also becomes more skilled in flagging the synthesized samples. This process is repeated until the inability for the discriminator to identify synthesized images reaches a pre-determined threshold.\n",
    "        - ***LSTM***: Stands for \"Long Short-Term Memory\". It is a type (successor) of RNN that hold onto certain points of data in \"memory cells\" that are used in later iterations of the model's data processing.\n",
    "        - ***Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Net***: the full name for what is commonly referred to as a \"neural network\". There is an input and output layer, with one or more hidden layers. Inputs are multiplied with weights and fed to the activation function, and in backpropagation, they are modified to reduce the loss.\n",
    "            - To speed up the process, the neural network can be unidirectional only and exclude backpropagation. This is called a ***Feed Forward Neural Network***.\n",
    "        - ***Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network***: Neurons store \"prototypes\" of data, which are generated from the training set. Test data is then compared to these prototypes, and those that are the most similar are given the most weight and pushed forward. The output layer consists of neurons equal to the number of classes that the neural network aims to classify the data.\n",
    "        - ***Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)***: Before the layer yielding outputs, the outcomes are fed *directly* back into the inputs to help predict the outcome of a given layer. This is done via a \"memory function\". Good for text data analysis.\n",

    "    - Parameter measurement is only valuable if the measurement is a reasonable representation of the data. In this respect, in order for the model to work, it must make assumptions in the data that the parameters do, in fact, represent the data and thus generate value.\n",

This makes sense: with new data to analyze, no assumptions can be made (i.e., you don't know if parameters can be identified in the dataset or not). If a trend in the data is found, then further analysis can be made with a parametric model.\n",

    "> *A learning model that summarizes data with a set of parameters of fixed size (independent of the number of training examples) is called a parametric model. No matter how much data you throw at a parametric model, it won’t change its mind about how many parameters it needs.* <br><br> \\[...\\] <br><br> *Nonparametric methods are good when you have a lot of data and no prior knowledge, and when you don’t want to worry too much about choosing just the right features.*\n",

    "        - *Benefit*: What is the advantage that the business gains as a result of the requirement implementation (e.g., functional streamlining, increase in quality, increase in ROI, overall drawing closer to strategy/business goals)?\n",

    "        - *Risk*: What is the probability that the requirement might not deliver the expected value? What is the probability that the requirement was initially misunderstood?\n",
    "        - *Dependencies*: Which requirements must be completed before other requirements can be implemented? (***see also*** \"Dependency\")\n",
    "        - *Time-Sensitivity*: Does the requirement expire, or is the need for the requirement seasonal?\n",
    "        - *Stability*: Likelihood of a requirement remaining static.\n",
    "        - *Regulatory/Policy Compliance*: Priority of requirement implementation must comport with law and regulations.\n",
    "    - Prioritization techniques include ((ironically) in no particular order):\n",
    "        - ***Ranking and Grouping***: Assigning requirements with numerical values and grouping those requirements into different priority groups. Simple, but very subjective.\n",
    "        - ***Dependency Map***: Tree-chart of requirement dependencies to determine which requirements even *can* be done before others.\n",
    "        - ***Bubble Sorting***: Compare two requirements to each other, and order them by priority. Then, compare one of the requirements with a new one, and order. Continue until the last requirement is sorted.\n",
    "        - ***100 Dollar Method***: All stakeholders are given a conceptual 100 dollars. They can distribute the dollars among requirements any way they like, including a stakeholder putting all 100 dollars into a single requirement. The highest totals are prioritized first. \n",
    "            - This method is good for a small group of requirements. It is often used as part of focus groups of stakeholder-based elicitation.\n",
    "        - ***Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)***: A conceptual method of starting with the largest overarching goal, and then decomposing the goal into smaller sub-problems. Then, goals on the same level of the hierarchy are compared to each other.\n",
    "            - This method is also only good for a small number of requirements, as the number of permutations of comparison can exponentially increase.\n",
    "        - ***Five Whys***: A method of elicitation to challenge the priority of features perceived as important to the stakeholder but unimportant to the developer. Asking \"why\" five times or less results in getting to the core of the professed importance of a requirement, where the developer can adjust priority accordingly.\n",
    "        - ***MoSCoW Method***: One of the more widely used techniques due to its simplicity and ease of use, this method categorizes requirements based on necessity:\n",
    "            - *(M)ust haves (a/k/a \"Minimum Usable Subset\")*: these features **must** be included before the product can be launched. Examples include (a) being unable to deliver on the target date without this data; (b) not legal without the requirement's inclusion; (c) unsafe without it; or (d) cannot adequately deliver the business case without it (***see*** \"Business Use Case\" under \"Use Case\").\n",
    "            - *(S)hould haves*: Features not critical for launch, but are nonetheless important and high value. In other words, without the should have requirement implemented, the solution is still viable, and work arounds exist for the lack of the requirement.\n",
    "            - *(C)ould haves*: Desirable features but are less important. These are the \"nice to haves\", where they could be included in the ultimate product, assuming it is not cost- or effort-prohibitive. Really only difference between this and Should haves is relative importance.\n",
    "            - *(W)on't haves*: Features that were initially requested but have been explicitly excluded from scope of the project (but may still be included in a future phase of development).\n",
    "                - The MoSCoW method aims for a split of 60% Musts, 40% combined Shoulds + Coulds, and 0% Won'ts. \n",
    "        - ***Kano Analysis***: Categorization technique similar to MoSCoW, but it is done from the point-of-view of customer satisfaction. It is broken into five categories:\n",
    "            - *Must-be Quality*: Requirements that a customer expects and takes for granted, such as a hotel providing a clean room to a new patron, or the existence of a customer service line for a company.\n",
    "            - *One Dimensional Quality*: The requirement generates satisfaction if fulfilled and dissatisfaction if not fulfilled. For example, giving an estimated time on hold for customer service will generate satisfaction if the call is answered within the time but dissatisfaction if being on hold excceeds estimate.\n",
    "            - *Attractive Quality*: The requirement generates satisfaction if fulfilled but does *not* generate dissatisfaction if not fulfilled. An example is a hotel offering free food to its patrons, or a customer service center providing instant resolution to an issue.\n",
    "            - *Indifferent Quality*: A requirement that is neither good nor bad. The thickness of a milk carton is an example, as a customer does not care about that.\n",
    "            - *Reverse Quality*: It is an attribute of a product that was intended for high achievement and satisfaction but ends up achieving the opposite result to some or all customers. An example is a customer service center using a lot of jargon or pleasantries, or a cell phone that has far too many extra features. \n",
    "        - ***ICE Framework***: Developed by tech entrepreneur Sean Ellis, it is assessing an average score across three factors, each scored from 0-10, to determine which features of a product should be prioritized: \n",

    "            - By definition, a search tree is one where \"the key for each node must be greater than any keys in the subtrees on the left\\[hand-side of the tree\\], and less than any keys in the subtrees on the right.\"\n",

    "    - These two terms involve the method of executing code.\n",
    "    - Compilation reads and executes code all at once by converting the code (now the \"compiled language\") into native machine code for processing.\n",
    "    - Interpretation executes certain lines code as many times as needed (e.g., an API call) - nothing is compiled/converted.\n",
    "        - While, in theory, virtually any programming language can be compiled or interpreted, common compilation languages are Java, C, and C++. Common interpreted languages (\"scripting languages\") are Python, Javascript, PHP, and related web programming languages.\n",
    "            - Again, these are examples of what the programming langauges are *commonly* used for. **V8**, a Javascript engine for Google Chrome, is compiled, not interpreted.\n",
    "         <br><br>\n",
    "    - ***Practical Differences between Compilation and Interpretation:***\n",
    "        - Compilation's conversion to native machine code makes compiled code much faster than language that needs to be interpreted for execution.\n",
    "        - Additionally, the compilation to native machine code makes the programming language adaptive to many platforms. Java is a good example of this.\n",
    "        - Executing all code at once results in reporting all errors in the single collective execution, instead of halting the execution at the first thrown error.\n",
    "        - The need for executing _all_ code or not determines which is better for processing. Again, the entire Javascript code for a webpage need not be \"executed\" every time an API call is made on the webpage.\n",
    "            - Permitting certain parts of code to execute on an automated basis is a key decision in using interpreted scripting languages.\n",

    "        - Here, \"Hello World\" will not print because `main()` MUST be declared in the HelloWorld class.  Python's `print(\"Hello World!\")` does not require this declaration because the interpreter includes defined classes and functions. In other words, not *everything* in the interpreted code must be included, whereas compiled code must have everything in the compilation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The core difference is that a **Virtual Machine is a hardware level process isolation, whereas a Container is an OS level process isolation.**\n",
    "    - Virtual Machine works directly on physical infrastructure. Containers create a \"container host OS\" kernel via an OS abstraction, which then acts on physical infrastructure. This makes containerization more portable, more lightweight, and overall faster to load and run up.\n",
    "    - Virtual Machines are multiple OS's running on a SINGLE piece of hardware. They each have their own partition and everything.\n",
    "    - Containers, on the otherhand is like a translator. The container engine sits atop the host OS/kernel, accessing only those libraries and bins of the OS image that are needed to run the containerized application(s).<br><br>\n",

    "        - Oracle VirtualBox <br><br>\n",
    "- **Pros and Cons to Virtual Machine vs. Containers**<br><br>\n",
    "    - ***Virtual Machine***\n",
    "        - **Pro**: having a dedicated kernel and operating system for each virtual machine means that if one VM kernel crashes, it doesn't affect the others.\n",
    "        - **Con**: using the same hardware to run multiple OS's takes a lot of time to boot, a lot of disk space, and isn't as portable as a Container. \n",
    "            - Also, it is hard to find (and manage) a VM that is appropriately configured for a user's specific needs.\n",
    "        - *Speed* = minutes (for startup time)\n",
    "        - *Disk space* = a lot\n",
    "        - *Operating system usage* = dedicated to the core kernel\n",
    "        - *Portability* = can be ported if the hardware is part of the same network and configured the same way. \n",
    "        - *Transferrability* = with a dedicated OS/kernel, a VM can move to a new host with ease. \n",
    "        - *Applicability* = with a complete OS GUI, you can do just about anything on the VM. \n",
    "        - *Flexibility* = There is complete flexibility of resources. When configuring a VM, one can say \"this is how many processors I want this machine to have, this much space to be partitioned (from the host server)\", etc. <br><br>\n",
    "    - ***Container***\n",
    "        - **Pro**: because the kernel is shared between the container image and the existing hardware, it is much faster/efficient, more portable and takes less disk space than a Virtual Machine. \n",
    "            - Also, there are many pre-configured containers that are readily available for home server apps.\n",
    "            - Finally, a container is good for security reasons. A containerized application only has access to those libraries and resources needed to run the application; the application does not see anything else on the computer.\n",
    "        - **Con**: The opposite of the pro of the VM - if the kernel were to go down, *all* containers using that kernel would go down.\n",
    "        - *Speed* = milliseconds (for startup time)\n",
    "        - *Disk space* = significantly less than that for VM\n",
    "        - *Operating system usage* = container shares resources with kernel, with kernel still running as normal. Additionally, this means that multiple containers can run on a single kernel/OS.\n",
    "        - *Portability* = container configuration can be accommodated by any system that can run container code (i.e., just about everything). \n",
    "            - Good for cloud usage for that reason, unlike VM.\n",
    "            - Not all systems can run container code. For example, a Linux-based container would not run on a Windows OS (though more recent OS's such as Windows 10 can accommodate such containers, and programs like ***Docker Toolkit*** address these compatability issues).\n",
    "        - *Transferrability* = since a container is tied to a specific kernel, the container would have to be terminated and recreated rather than moved.\n",
    "        - *Applicability* = a container is merely an image, making container technology appropriate for really only web-based applications.\n",
    "        - *Flexibility* = For allocation of resources, containers can be governed by ***control groups*** (within a configuration \"Docker file\"), which limit the amount of resources each container is taking up.\n",
