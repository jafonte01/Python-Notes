    "    - An intentional simplification of an actual system for purposes of turning focus to a higher-level concept.\n",
    "    - For example, \"0\" and \"1\" representing \"off\" and \"on\" is an abstraction for how circuits work. In actuality, transistors have threshold voltages that may differ between computers, but having to explain bits with certain voltage ranges results in immediate overcomplication.\n",
    "    - Another example is logic gates symbols being an abstraction for what the circuitry actually is like, and how lines for a hardware schematic are an abstraction for more detailed connections.\n",

    "    - For data consistency in transactions, it must satisfy ***ACID*** properties before the transaction can be considered completed. While considered only a single operation, \"ACID\" is an acronym for four separate properties that must be satisfied:\n",
    "        - *Atomicity*: Every data element is considered its own transaction. If one transaction fails, the whole transaction fails, and the database is left unchanged.\n",
    "        - *Consistency*: The change to a database must satisfy all constraints, rules, and triggers.\n",
    "        - *Isolation*: A type of concurrency check - if transactions are executed concurrently (they often are), the concurrent execution must achieve the same result as if the transactions were executed sequentially.\n",
    "        - *Durability*: After a transaction is completed, it remains committed to memory (i.e., it is stored in non-volatile memory).\n",

    "        - For example, a ***filesystem ACL*** sets the permissions of users for access to a given computing system.\n",
    "        - This is contrasted with a ***networking ACL***, which sets the permissions of who can access the network (like who can get onto a WiFi router).\n",
    "        - A more granular version of an ACL is a ***Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)***, where an administrator can set permissions to users within an organization based on a given \"role\" of the user.\n",

    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Application Programming Interface (\"API\")**</u> (*DevOps // Networking & IT // Interface/IDE*)</span>\n",
    "    - In layman’s terms, an API is a gateway in which two systems respond to each other - one system sends information, the API interprets and routes the information, and the second system receives the information. This is akin to a waiter (API) moving a food order (the information) between the patrons (sender) and the kitchen (receiver).\n",
    "    - A good overview of API's is [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTSQjw5DrM&list=WL&index=34).\n",
    "    - There are two main types of API protocols:<br>\n",
    "        1. ***REST*** - Stands for \"REpresentational State Transfer\" \\[Protocol\\].\n",
    "            - REST sets constraints in  which data can pass through the API between two (or more) systems within a network.\n",
    "            - When a web API can accommodate a REST framework (i.e., obeys the constraints of REST), it is said to be ***RESTful***.\n",
    "                - Likewise, a RESTful/user-friendly website is said to have a ***Clean URL***.\n",
    "            - REST is newer and more widely used than SOAP (see below).\n",
    "            - A REST API call contains four (4) main pieces (for web API's using HTTP):\n",
    "                - *Endpoint*: The URL of the API to which the user seeks to obtain or post data.\n",
    "                    - A URL is for web API's. A more general term for an endpoint is a ***URI*** (\"Uniform Resource Identifier\").\n",
    "                - *Content/Headers*: The specific syntax of the API call. It can be set to \"application/JSON\"; \"xml-encoded\", \"xxx-www-URL-encoded\", or others.\n",
    "                - *Method*: The exact action to be taken with the API call. There are only four different kinds of methods within HTTP:\n",
    "                    - a. GET - Request and pull information from the endpoint network.\n",
    "                        - (This is laymen's terms. More accurately it is defined as \"Get a representation of the target resource's state\").\n",
    "                    - b. POST - Add and/or update information to the endpoint network\n",
    "                        - (\"Let the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request\").\n",
    "                    - c. PUT - A combination of POST and DELETE - it is a replacement of data on the endpoint network.\n",
    "                        - (\"Create or replace the state of the target resource with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request\").\n",
    "                    - d. DELETE - Outright delete the target resource. Obviously used quite rarely.\n",
    "                - *Body*: The actual data, set to whatever syntax and formatting identified by the header. If the header is not identified, an error will be thrown.<br><br>\n",
    "        2. ***SOAP*** - Stands for \"Simple Object Access Protocol\".\n",
    "            - Unlike REST, there is an official standard for SOAP, including that it only uses XML formatting.\n",
    "                - For this reason, a header does not need to be identified.\n",
    "            - SOAP is older than REST but is still used, especially when interacting with older software.\n",
    "            - One major benefit to SOAP over REST is that it is protocol agnostic; it can run across programming models, including between differing operating systems, and use any protocol (HTTP, SMTP, and TCP).\n",
    "            - There are only two (2) required pieces to a SOAP call:\n",
    "                - a. *Envelope*: Identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.\n",
    "                - b. *Body*: Contains call ***and*** response information.\n",

    "    - Artifacts vary in maintainability as well as their role in the software development process. For example, artifacts are project management milestones as deliverables.\n",
    "    - In the more general sense - with the definition taken from \"artifact\" from life sciences - an artifact \"refers to something that arises from the process at hand rather than the issue itself, i.e., a result of interest that stems from the means rather than the end\".\n",

    "    - Sometimes referred to as ***asm*** or ***Symbolic Machine Code***.\n",
    "    - Unlike raw machine code instructions, an assembler program stores expressions and variables (as \"symbolic names\") when operating; without this, a programmer would need to keep track of updated addresses line by line.\n",
    "    - There are two main types of assembly language: <br><br>\n",

Cloud computing is based on pay-as-you-go models, so needing a big lump sum as a capital expenditure upfront for additional computing resources (where getting managerial approval for such a thing normally takes so long anyway that by the time you get it, you probably will need even *more* resources by that time) can be avoided.\n",

This would not be possible with an isolated on-premises environment. The reduced time-to-market of applications frees up time so that devs can focus on other things, like innovative/creative designing.\n",

    "                - Fun fact: a relational model is not called \"Relational\" because of the connections between tables. Rather, a relational database is \"relational\" because it utilizes relational algebra (cartesian products, set theory formulae, etc.). The practical distinction between this and its more colloquial usage is non-existent.\n",

    "                - Moreover, a relational model inherently needs a schema, and if you don't know the connections between tables, and/or if you don't know where certain data is found, you can be at a significant loss.\n",
    "             - Relational models must be ACID compliant (***see*** \"ACID\"), which makes this database model much more difficult to scale.\n",

    "            - A *wide-column key-value model* is the same as the previous model, but the \"value\" is an object containing more than one piece of information (think of a JSON object with arrays and discrete pieces of data that may be of different data types). \n",
    "                - It is faster than a relational database since it is decentralized and schema-less, but because of this, the data may not be as organized as intuitively as a relational database (and there are no \"joins\" of any sorts as a result). \n",

    "        - **Object-Oriented Relational Model (OORM)**: A combination of the above two - the data is stored as separate objects, but these objects can be accessed relationally, which allows for querying and data manipulation. Examples are as follows:\n",
    "            - A *document-oriented database* is a double grouping of objects. Each object is a \"document\" - a JSON containing multiple key-value pairs, and multiple documents are grouped as a \"collection\" object.\n",

    "                - Good for data that doesn't really need a specific schema, as it is faster than a relational model. However, if the data needs to be connected in various ways, a document-oriented database would not suffice - a document is a microcosm of data in that respect - only the collections are related.\n",

    "> Data governance encompasses the people, processes, and information technology required to create a consistent and proper handling of an organization's data across the business enterprise. It provides all data management practices with the necessary foundation, strategy, and structure needed to ensure that data is managed as an asset and transformed into meaningful information. Goals may be defined at all levels of the enterprise and doing so may aid in acceptance of processes by those who will use them.\n",

    "    <br><br>\n",
    "- A variety of data terms fall under the field of Data Governance:\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Data Cleaning/Data Cleansing**:</u></span> The process of detecting and correcting or removing corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset or database. Not to be confused with \"data scrubbing\" (see below).\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Data Curation**</u>:</span> The process of organizing and integrating data collected from various sources. An example is \"curating\" a scientific article before it is entered into a scientific database.\n",

    "    - <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Data Protection**:</u></span> A description of all processes to literally \"protect\" the data from unauthorized changes. Protection includes two types: digital, such as data encryption to protect against malware or ransomware, or physical, such as backing up data due to hardware failure, exeternal damage, etc. (called ***Disaster Recovery (\"DR\") Work or DR Management***).\n",
    "        - As a general statement from Ari Saperstein of Cohesity: \"Tape is dead. Don't use it.\" (To translate): Legacy means of storage are too fragile for continued use. Tape specifically is subject to being erased by magnets (so don't put them in a bank vault with magnetic doors) and becoming brittle and breaking under very cold temperatures (or at the very least, being subject to condensation on the inside when the tape is heating up).\n",

This often requires a data steward to implement standards and controls before the data is transferred to another department for use.\n",
    "        - This is different from **data custodianship**, which is the task of transporting and storing data in accordance with data protection rules of the business. Data stewards are responsible for what is stored in a data field, while data custodians are responsible for the technical environment and database structure.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",

    "        - Transactions must have ***data consistency***, which requires that all servers in a distributed system acknowledge and reflect the database transaction.\n",
    "            - Data consistency is its own separate computer science term. ***See*** Data Consistency.\n",
    "            - For data consistency in transactions, it must satisfy ACID properties before the transaction can be considered completed. \n",
    "                - ***See*** \"ACID Compliance\".\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",

    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Data Wrangling/Data Munging**:</u></span> The process of finding and obtaining raw data and transforming/mapping it to another format more accessible and valuable for a later downstream process (e.g., analytics).\n",
    "        - This is the first step of the data life cycle.\n",
    "        - To \"munge\" is to make changes or transformations to a piece of data, which may be potentially destructive and/or irrevocable. Common munging operations include: HTML tagging, data parsing, data filtering, and data transformation.\n",

    "    - De-normalization is the intentional practice of including duplicates to increase read performance of a database, at the inevitable expense of loss of write performance.\n",
    "    - Unintentional de-normalization results in duplicate elements, where some elements may be updated and others are not, which creates big problems when updating important data.\n",
    "        - To avoid this, enforce the practice and paradigm of Single Source of Truth. ***See*** Single Source of Truth (SSOT).\n",
    "        - De-Normalization, however, is not uncommon with NoSQL databases. In contrast to SQL databases, NoSQL data is hierarchical instead of merely relational, meaning that some data elements may need to be repeated in order to establish or maintain that hierarchy of data. This is why the term \"*unintentional* de-normalization\" is used.\n",
    "            - In other words, the relational aspect of a SQL database makes tables dependent on each other, since critical data elements are not copied in every table. By contrast: \"A denormalized form is a form in which a table \\[is\\] not dependent on another table for data.\"\n",

    "        - All at once - good if you *know* the environment is up and ready to respond to requests.\n",
    "        - Rolling - one batch of features or data at a time.\n",
    "            - *Alternatively*, if computing across multiple instances within a network, \"rolling\" means deploying to each instance (or batch of instances) at a time.\n",
    "            - A similar idea is \"rolling with additional batch\" - if the app is being deployed on two production instances out of 20, to maintain the development environment, two instances would have to be *created* (instead of replaced) for a total of 22, with the new 2 as the production instances. Good for maintaining traffic during the deployment.\n",
    "        - Immutable - maintaining both environments *temporarily*. \n",
    "            - This means if a dev environment of 20 instances is deploying, another 20 instances as the new prod environment will need to be temporarily created.\n",
    "        - Blue-Green - maintaining both environments *indefinitely*.\n",
    "            - Blue-green deployment is essentially switching endpoints for requests. One environment will be the dev environment (testing & configuration), and the other the production environment (handling live requests). Once the dev environment is updated and ready to be deployed, the dev environment *becomes* the prod environment, and the prod environment becomes the dev environment.

    "    - Model-View designs are a set of architectural frameworks (***see*** \"Web Framework\").\n",
    "    - The most popular types are ***Model-View-Controller (MVC)*** and ***Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)***.\n",
    "        - MVC is a model where three components of a website are completely separated; changes to one do not affect the other two components. The structure of MVC is as follows:\n",
    "            - *Model:* The object that is being presented. *Example:* An HTML form on a webpage.\n",
    "            - *View:* Something that is able to \"see\" the model. *Example:* a web browser that renders the webpage with the form.\n",
    "            - *Controller:* The mechanisms that are triggered when the model is manipulated, along with how the model accepts the initial inputs. *Example:* functions that handle form data when it is submitted.\n",
    "        - A ***Hierarchical Model-View-Controller (HMVC)*** is when the controller accepts subroutines and manipulates the Model *before* the Controller gives the View access to the Model. This is used when changes are made inline, such as when a comment is posted on a webpage without having to reload the webpage in its entirety (i.e., for a traditional MVC, it would have to do a second HTTP GET request). \n",
    "        - For MVVM, instead of a controller dictating the state of the Model, a \"ViewModel\" binds communications from the View to the state of the data in the Model, which changes the View in turn.\n",
    "    - A variant of MVC is ***Model-View-Presenter (MVP)***, where the Presenter (controller) modifies the Model itself. One example is a relational data table - a presenter would retrieve data and output it to a new query output table.\n",
    "        - The difference between MVP and MVVM is that the Presenter merely works with the Model separate from the View, whereas in MVVM, the View directly binds to properties of the ViewModel to send and receive updates.\n",
    "    - Another variant is ***Model-View-Adapter (MVA)***, where the Adapter modifies the View for the user, but in reality, it is retaining the original shape and state of the model. This is good for when a model should not be configurable.\n",
    "        - Given the middle-man nature of the Adapter between the View and the Model in this design, the design is alternatively called a \"mediating-controller MVC\".\n",
    "    - A final variant example of MVC is the ***Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC)***. Here, the abstraction is the Model and the processing of the data therein; the Presentation is the View, and the Control is the functionality controlling the flow and communication between the other two components.\n",
    "        - The difference between PAC and MVC is that PAC is hierarchical, making there be zero communication between Presentation and Abstraction (whereas MVC has interconnectivity between all three components on some level). In doing so, this allows the GUI/Presentation to be shown before the Abstraction has even fully initialized.\n",

    "        - Exactly how this simulation works is as follows: values are sampled at random (i.e., stochastically) from the input set and produces an outcome from that sample. The simulation iterates hundreds to thousands of times over, thus forming a probability distribution of possible outcomes that resembles the global distribution.\n",
    "            - Identifying what variables are the input for this simulation allows for better analysis of variable correlations than deterministic methods, which don't offer a probability distribution.\n",

    "    - A good requirement will be SMART (sensible, measurable, attainable, etc.), clear, understandable, consistent with other requirements, and easily verifiable.\n",
    "    - With a waterfall development method, requirements are set forth before design and implementation, while agile and other iterative development methods have requirements set forth in parallel to the design and implementation.\n",

    "- <span style=\"color:#00008B\"><u>**Requirement Prioritization**</u> (*DevOps // Business Term/Program*)</span>    \n",
    "    - Because development and implementation is often incremental (i.e., instead of delivering a complete application, a company will deliver a beta product, test and update with CI/CD), requirements must be addressed in a certain order. \n",
    "    - Succinct definition: \"product management process for determining which candidate requirements of a software product should be included in a certain release\".\n",
    "    - When prioritizing, the following business factors are to be considered (taken from \"Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK)\" (ed. 3.0)):\n",
    "        - *Benefit*: What is the advantage that the business gains as a result of the requirement implementation (e.g., functional streamlining, increase in quality, increase in ROI, overall drawing closer to strategy/business goals)?\n",
    "        - *Penalty*: What is the consequence of not implementing a requirement (e.g., poor customer satisfaction, lower usability of product, exposure to liability from regulatory bodies)?\n",
    "        - *Cost*: What are the resources (financial, manpower, or technology) needed to implement the requirement?\n",
    "        - *Risk*: What is the probability that the requirement might not deliver the expected value? What is the probability that the requirement was initially misunderstood?\n",
    "        - *Dependencies*: Which requirements must be completed before other requirements can be implemented? (***see also*** \"Dependency\")\n",
    "        - *Time-Sensitivity*: Does the requirement expire, or is the need for the requirement seasonal?\n",
    "        - *Stability*: Likelihood of a requirement remaining static.\n",
    "        - *Regulatory/Policy Compliance*: Priority of requirement implementation must comport with law and regulations.\n",
    "    - Prioritization techniques include ((ironically) in no particular order):\n",
    "        - ***Ranking and Grouping***: Assigning requirements with numerical values and grouping those requirements into different priority groups. Simple, but very subjective.\n",
    "        - ***Dependency Map***: Tree-chart of requirement dependencies to determine which requirements even *can* be done before others.\n",
    "        - ***Bubble Sorting***: Compare two requirements to each other, and order them by priority. Then, compare one of the requirements with a new one, and order. Continue until the last requirement is sorted.\n",
    "        - ***100 Dollar Method***: All stakeholders are given a conceptual 100 dollars. They can distribute the dollars among requirements any way they like, including a stakeholder putting all 100 dollars into a single requirement. The highest totals are prioritized first. \n",
    "            - This method is good for a small group of requirements. It is often used as part of focus groups of stakeholder-based elicitation.\n",
    "        - ***Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)***: A conceptual method of starting with the largest overarching goal, and then decomposing the goal into smaller sub-problems. Then, goals on the same level of the hierarchy are compared to each other.\n",
    "            - This method is also only good for a small number of requirements, as the number of permutations of comparison can exponentially increase.\n",
    "        - ***Five Whys***: A method of elicitation to challenge the priority of features perceived as important to the stakeholder but unimportant to the developer. Asking \"why\" five times or less results in getting to the core of the professed importance of a requirement, where the developer can adjust priority accordingly.\n",
    "        - ***MoSCoW Method***: One of the more widely used techniques due to its simplicity and ease of use, this method categorizes requirements based on necessity:\n",
    "            - *(M)ust haves (a/k/a \"Minimum Usable Subset\")*: these features **must** be included before the product can be launched. Examples include (a) being unable to deliver on the target date without this data; (b) not legal without the requirement's inclusion; (c) unsafe without it; or (d) cannot adequately deliver the business case without it (***see*** \"Business Use Case\" under \"Use Case\").\n",
    "            - *(S)hould haves*: Features not critical for launch, but are nonetheless important and high value. In other words, without the should have requirement implemented, the solution is still viable, and work arounds exist for the lack of the requirement.\n",
    "            - *(C)ould haves*: Desirable features but are less important. These are the \"nice to haves\", where they could be included in the ultimate product, assuming it is not cost- or effort-prohibitive. Really only difference between this and Should haves is relative importance.\n",
    "            - *(W)on't haves*: Features that were initially requested but have been explicitly excluded from scope of the project (but may still be included in a future phase of development).\n",
    "                - The MoSCoW method aims for a split of 60% Musts, 40% combined Shoulds + Coulds, and 0% Won'ts. \n",
    "        - ***Kano Analysis***: Categorization technique similar to MoSCoW, but it is done from the point-of-view of customer satisfaction. It is broken into five categories:\n",
    "            - *Must-be Quality*: Requirements that a customer expects and takes for granted, such as a hotel providing a clean room to a new patron, or the existence of a customer service line for a company.\n",
    "            - *One Dimensional Quality*: The requirement generates satisfaction if fulfilled and dissatisfaction if not fulfilled. For example, giving an estimated time on hold for customer service will generate satisfaction if the call is answered within the time but dissatisfaction if being on hold excceeds estimate.\n",
    "            - *Attractive Quality*: The requirement generates satisfaction if fulfilled but does *not* generate dissatisfaction if not fulfilled. An example is a hotel offering free food to its patrons, or a customer service center providing instant resolution to an issue.\n",
    "            - *Indifferent Quality*: A requirement that is neither good nor bad. The thickness of a milk carton is an example, as a customer does not care about that.\n",
    "            - *Reverse Quality*: It is an attribute of a product that was intended for high achievement and satisfaction but ends up achieving the opposite result to some or all customers. An example is a customer service center using a lot of jargon or pleasantries, or a cell phone that has far too many extra features. \n",
    "        - ***ICE Framework***: Developed by tech entrepreneur Sean Ellis, it is assessing an average score across three factors, each scored from 0-10, to determine which features of a product should be prioritized: \n",
    "            - *(I)mpact*: How effective does this product feature help draw the business closer to its strategic goal, whether it be increase market share by converting a customer, and/or increase capital by maximizing ROI? \n",
    "                - One way to to evaluate this is by determining how fast and/or far the feature advances a customer through ***AARRR*** (Initial customer (A)quisition, (A)ctiving and engaging a customer with the product, (R)etention of the customer for long-term product engagement, the generation of (R)eferrals from retained customers to new ones, and (R)evenue being generated from customer engagement).\n",
    "            - *(C)onfidence*: A measurement of the \"conviction required\" to warrant addressing a particular feature. In other words, how much evidence do we have to support the level of anticipated impact?\n",
    "                - A measurement of confidence values can be found with [this graphic](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*AwSnjz4xNlxY0f-rkUJ8oA.png).\n",
    "            - *(E)ase*: How much resources will be used to realize this feature? Though factors include analyses of cost-benefit and opportunity cost, time is usually the metric used for Ease. For example, Ease can be scored inversely by the number of agile/scrum sprint cycles multiplied by the number of developers used.\n",
    "            - After determining the scores, features are often categorized into three buckets: (1) *sprint backlog* (highest priority features); (2) *product backlog* (features that need to be developed for a complete product, but are not highest priority); and (3) *icebox features* (features that aren't going to be worked on any time soon but aren't officially thrown away as viable ideas, such as fixing low priority bugs or commonly requested yet low value features).\n",
    "                - A good visualization for ICE is a ***Pugh Decision Matrix***, which compares scores of criteria against scores of criteria of alternative solutions.\n",
    "        - ***GIST***: Where ICE deals with feature prioritization, GIST is the roadmap to effect & ship those features:\n",
    "            - *(G)oals*: The aggregation of *OKR* (\"Objectives\" (top-line goals) and \"Key-Results\" (measurable benchmarks to determine satisfaction of an objective)\n",
    "            - *(I)deas*: The activities that will lead to desired results. These are delegated to certain teams and/or individuals.\n",
    "            - *(S)tep Projects*: A breakdown of objectives into 5 or 10-week long sprint cycle projects. Useful for meeting quarterly targets.\n",
    "            - *(T)asks*: Bite-sized assignments within step projects that advance the development of an application. To come full circle, the priority of these assignments is determined by an ICE analysis.\n",

    "    - These two terms involve the method of executing code.\n",
    "    - Compilation reads and executes code all at once by converting the code (now the \"compiled language\") into native machine code for processing.\n",
    "    - Interpretation executes certain lines code as many times as needed (e.g., an API call) - nothing is compiled/converted.\n",
    "        - While, in theory, virtually any programming language can be compiled or interpreted, common compilation languages are Java, C, and C++. Common interpreted languages (\"scripting languages\") are Python, Javascript, PHP, and related web programming languages.\n",
    "            - Again, these are examples of what the programming langauges are *commonly* used for. **V8**, a Javascript engine for Google Chrome, is compiled, not interpreted.\n",
    "         <br><br>\n",
    "    - ***Practical Differences between Compilation and Interpretation:***\n",
    "        - Compilation's conversion to native machine code makes compiled code much faster than language that needs to be interpreted for execution.\n",
    "        - Additionally, the compilation to native machine code makes the programming language adaptive to many platforms. Java is a good example of this.\n",
    "        - Executing all code at once results in reporting all errors in the single collective execution, instead of halting the execution at the first thrown error.\n",
    "        - The need for executing _all_ code or not determines which is better for processing. Again, the entire Javascript code for a webpage need not be \"executed\" every time an API call is made on the webpage.\n",
    "            - Permitting certain parts of code to execute on an automated basis is a key decision in using interpreted scripting languages.\n",

    "- The core difference is that a **Virtual Machine is a hardware level process isolation, whereas a Container is an OS level process isolation.**\n",
    "    - Virtual Machine works directly on physical infrastructure. Containers create a \"container host OS\" kernel via an OS abstraction, which then acts on physical infrastructure. This makes containerization more portable, more lightweight, and overall faster to load and run up.\n",
    "    - Virtual Machines are multiple OS's running on a SINGLE piece of hardware. They each have their own partition and everything.\n",
    "    - Containers, on the otherhand is like a translator. The container engine sits atop the host OS/kernel, accessing only those libraries and bins of the OS image that are needed to run the containerized application(s).<br><br>\n",

    "- **Pros and Cons to Virtual Machine vs. Containers**<br><br>\n",
    "    - ***Virtual Machine***\n",
    "        - **Pro**: having a dedicated kernel and operating system for each virtual machine means that if one VM kernel crashes, it doesn't affect the others.\n",
    "        - **Con**: using the same hardware to run multiple OS's takes a lot of time to boot, a lot of disk space, and isn't as portable as a Container. \n",
    "            - Also, it is hard to find (and manage) a VM that is appropriately configured for a user's specific needs.\n",
    "        - *Speed* = minutes (for startup time)\n",
    "        - *Disk space* = a lot\n",
    "        - *Operating system usage* = dedicated to the core kernel\n",
    "        - *Portability* = can be ported if the hardware is part of the same network and configured the same way. \n",
    "        - *Transferrability* = with a dedicated OS/kernel, a VM can move to a new host with ease. \n",
    "        - *Applicability* = with a complete OS GUI, you can do just about anything on the VM. \n",
    "        - *Flexibility* = There is complete flexibility of resources. When configuring a VM, one can say \"this is how many processors I want this machine to have, this much space to be partitioned (from the host server)\", etc. <br><br>\n",
    "    - ***Container***\n",
    "        - **Pro**: because the kernel is shared between the container image and the existing hardware, it is much faster/efficient, more portable and takes less disk space than a Virtual Machine. \n",
    "            - Also, there are many pre-configured containers that are readily available for home server apps.\n",
    "            - Finally, a container is good for security reasons. A containerized application only has access to those libraries and resources needed to run the application; the application does not see anything else on the computer.\n",
    "        - **Con**: The opposite of the pro of the VM - if the kernel were to go down, *all* containers using that kernel would go down.\n",
    "        - *Speed* = milliseconds (for startup time)\n",
    "        - *Disk space* = significantly less than that for VM\n",
    "        - *Operating system usage* = container shares resources with kernel, with kernel still running as normal. Additionally, this means that multiple containers can run on a single kernel/OS.\n",
    "        - *Portability* = container configuration can be accommodated by any system that can run container code (i.e., just about everything). \n",
    "            - Good for cloud usage for that reason, unlike VM.\n",
    "            - Not all systems can run container code. For example, a Linux-based container would not run on a Windows OS (though more recent OS's such as Windows 10 can accommodate such containers, and programs like ***Docker Toolkit*** address these compatability issues).\n",
    "        - *Transferrability* = since a container is tied to a specific kernel, the container would have to be terminated and recreated rather than moved.\n",
    "        - *Applicability* = a container is merely an image, making container technology appropriate for really only web-based applications.\n",
    "        - *Flexibility* = For allocation of resources, containers can be governed by ***control groups*** (within a configuration \"Docker file\"), which limit the amount of resources each container is taking up.\n",
