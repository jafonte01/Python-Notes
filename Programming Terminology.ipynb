    "- __Database Management System (DBMS)__ (_Database // Interface/IDE_):\n",
    "    - A software system that enables a user to define, create, maintain, and control access to a database. \n",
    "        - The term \"database\" simply refers to the location where data is stored. Interacting with that storage location uses a DBMS.\n",
    "    - How a DBMS is logically structured depends on the specific ___database model___ that it uses. The type of database model affects the ___schema___, i.e., how the data is mapped and outputted to the user in the DBMS (e.g., as rows and columns).\n",
    "    - Examples of database models are:\n",
    "        - __Relational Model (RM)__: Data is organized into tuples, which a user can declare which data goes where, and where the data is \"in relation to\" other data.\n",
    "            - By formal definition, a ___relation___ is a set of tuples (each one being a _row_ of data) containing data elements of differing _atrributes_ (columns), thus forming a table. The resulting table is the \"relation\".\n",
    "            - Relational models are the most common, as SQL can often traverse this model with ease.\n",
    "        - __Object(-Oriented) Model (OOM)__: Each table is its own \"object\", and rows of data underneath the table are individual instances of that object.\n",
    "        - __Object-Oriented Relational Model (OORM)__: A combination of the above two - the data is stored as separate objects, but these objects can be accessed relationally, which allows for querying and data manipulation.\n",

    "    - A field of data management concerning the capability of an organization to ensure high data quality for the entirety of the data lifecycle (i.e., from acquisition to storage, maintenance, and security).\n",
    "        - The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance) definition: \n",
    "> Data governance encompasses the people, processes, and information technology required to create a consistent and proper handling of an organization's data across the business enterprise. It provides all data management practices with the necessary foundation, strategy, and structure needed to ensure that data is managed as an asset and transformed into meaningful information. Goals may be defined at all levels of the enterprise and doing so may aid in acceptance of processes by those who will use them.\n",

    "    \n",

    "    - __Data Cleaning/Data Cleansing__: The process of detecting and correcting or removing corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset or database. Not to be confused with \"data scrubbing\" (see below).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - __Data Curation__: The process of organizing and integrating data collected from various sources. An example is \"curating\" a scientific article before it is entered into a scientific database.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - __Data Dictionary__: A metadata repository of the data, containing information such as the meaning, origin, usage, and format of the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - __Data Element__: A generic term for a single unit of \"data\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - __Data Integrity__: The maintenance and assurance of the accuracy and consistency of data over its life cycle. This includes both physical and digital integrity. See \"Data Protection\".\n",
    "        - The opposite of data integrity is ___data corruption.___\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - __Data Protection__ A description of all processes to literally \"protect\" the data from unauthorized changes. Protection includes two types: digital, such as data encryption to protect against malware or ransomware, or physical, such as backing up data due to hardware failure, exeternal damage, etc. (called ___Disaster Recovery (\"DR\") Work or DR Management___).\n",
    "        - As a general statement from Ari Saperstein of Cohesity: \"Tape is dead. Don't use it.\" (To translate): Legacy means of storage are too fragile for continued use. Tape specifically is subject to being erased by magnets (so don't put them in a bank vault with magnetic doors) and becoming brittle and breaking under very cold temperatures (or at the very least, being subject to condensation on the inside when the tape is heating up).\n",
    "        - The term ___Data Security___ lends itself more to the digital aspect, and Data Protection lends itself more to the physical aspect, but overall, the terms are interchangeable.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - __Data Quality__: The manipulation of data to yield data content that is \"fit for its intended uses in operations, decision making, and planning.\"\n",
    "        - The degree of quality is defined as the \"degree to which a set of characteristics of data fulfills requirements.\" (See \"Requirements\".)\n",

    "        \n",
    "    - __Data Stewardship__: A data steward is a role in a company dedicated to maintaining & curating data to ensure data fitness of the content of the data as well as the metadata of that data. This often requires a data steward to implement standards and controls before the data is transferred to another department for use.\n",
    "        - This is different from __data custodianship__, which is the task of transporting and storing data in accordance with data protection rules of the business. Data stewards are responsible for what is stored in a data field, while data custodians are responsible for the technical environment and database structure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - __Database Transaction__: A term for a single unit of work/change performed within a database management system against a database.\n",
    "        - Transactions must have ___data consistency___, which requires that all servers in a distributed system acknowledge and reflect the database transaction.\n",
    "            - Data consistency is its own separate computer science term. See Data Consistency.\n",
    "            - For data consistency in transactions, it must satisfy ___ACID___ properties before the transaction can be considered completed. While considered only a single operation, \"ACID\" is an acronym for four separate properties that must be satisfied:\n",
    "                - _Atomicity_: Every data element is considered its own transaction. If one transaction fails, the whole transaction fails, and the database is left unchanged.\n",
    "                - _Consistency_: The change to a database must satisfy all constraints, rules, and triggers.\n",
