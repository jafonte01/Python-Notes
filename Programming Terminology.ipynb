    "    - An intentional simplification of an actual system for purposes of turning focus to a higher-level concept.\n",
    "    - For example, \"0\" and \"1\" representing \"off\" and \"on\" is an abstraction for how circuits work. In actuality, transistors have threshold voltages that may differ between computers, but having to explain bits with certain voltage ranges results in immediate overcomplication.\n",

    "        - _Atomicity_: Every data element is considered its own transaction. If one transaction fails, the whole transaction fails, and the database is left unchanged.\n",
    "        - _Consistency_: The change to a database must satisfy all constraints, rules, and triggers.\n",
    "        - _Isolation_: A type of concurrency check - if transactions are executed concurrently (they often are), the concurrent execution must achieve the same result as if the transactions were executed sequentially.\n",

    "    - Compilation reads and executes code all at once by converting the code (now the \"compiled language\") into native machine code for processing.\n",
    "    - Interpretation executes certain lines code as many times as needed (e.g., an API call) - nothing is compiled/converted.\n",
    "        - While, in theory, virtually any programming language can be compiled or interpreted, common compilation languages are Java, C, and C++. Common interpreted languages (\"scripting languages\") are Python, Javascript, PHP, and related web programming languages.\n",
    "            - Again, these are examples of what the programming langauges are _commonly_ used for. __V8__, a Javascript engine for Google Chrome, is compiled, not interpreted.\n",
    "         <br><br>\n",
    "    - ___Practical Differences between Compilation and Interpretation:___\n",
    "        - Compilation's conversion to native machine code makes compiled code much faster than language that needs to be interpreted for execution.\n",
    "        - Additionally, the compilation to native machine code makes the programming language adaptive to many platforms. Java is a good example of this.\n",
    "        - Executing all code at once results in reporting all errors in the single collective execution, instead of halting the execution at the first thrown error.\n",
    "        - The need for executing _all_ code or not determines which is better for processing. Again, the entire Javascript code for a webpage need not be \"executed\" every time an API call is made on the webpage.\n",
    "            - Permitting certain parts of code to execute on an automated basis is a key decision in using interpreted scripting languages.\n",

    "<p></p>\n",
    "        - Here, \"Hello World\" will not print because `main()` MUST be declared in the HelloWorld class.  Python's `print(\"Hello World!\")` does not require this declaration because the interpreter includes defined classes and functions. In other words, not *everything* in the interpreted code must be included, whereas compiled code must have everything in the compilation.\n",

Goals may be defined at all levels of the enterprise and doing so may aid in acceptance of processes by those who will use them.\n",

    "- A variety of data terms fall under the field of Data Governance:\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:#00008B\">__Data Cleaning/Data Cleansing__:</span> The process of detecting and correcting or removing corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset or database. Not to be confused with \"data scrubbing\" (see below).\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:#00008B\">__Data Curation__:</span> The process of organizing and integrating data collected from various sources. An example is \"curating\" a scientific article before it is entered into a scientific database.\n",

    "        - As a general statement from Ari Saperstein of Cohesity: \"Tape is dead. Don't use it.\" (To translate): Legacy means of storage are too fragile for continued use. Tape specifically is subject to being erased by magnets (so don't put them in a bank vault with magnetic doors) and becoming brittle and breaking under very cold temperatures (or at the very least, being subject to condensation on the inside when the tape is heating up).\n",

This often requires a data steward to implement standards and controls before the data is transferred to another department for use.\n",
    "        - This is different from __data custodianship__, which is the task of transporting and storing data in accordance with data protection rules of the business.
