    "        - *Consistency*: The change to a database must satisfy all constraints, rules, and triggers.\n",
    "        - *Isolation*: A type of concurrency check - if transactions are executed concurrently (they often are), the concurrent execution must achieve the same result as if the transactions were executed sequentially.\n",

    "        - Additionally, the compilation to native machine code makes the programming language adaptive to many platforms. Java is a good example of this.\n",

    "    - Succinct definition: \"product management process for determining which candidate requirements of a software product should be included in a certain release\".\n",
    "    - When prioritizing, the following business factors are to be considered (taken from \"Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK)\" (ed. 3.0)):\n",
    "        - *Benefit*: What is the advantage that the business gains as a result of the requirement implementation (e.g., functional streamlining, increase in quality, increase in ROI, overall drawing closer to strategy/business goals)?\n",
    "        - *Penalty*: What is the consequence of not implementing a requirement (e.g., poor customer satisfaction, lower usability of product, exposure to liability from regulatory bodies)?\n",
    "        - *Cost*: What are the resources (financial, manpower, or technology) needed to implement the requirement?\n",
    "        - *Risk*: What is the probability that the requirement might not deliver the expected value? What is the probability that the requirement was initially misunderstood?\n",
    "        - *Dependencies*: Which requirements must be completed before other requirements can be implemented? (***see also*** \"Dependency\")\n",
    "        - *Time-Sensitivity*: Does the requirement expire, or is the need for the requirement seasonal?\n",
    "        - *Stability*: Likelihood of a requirement remaining static.\n",
    "        - *Regulatory/Policy Compliance*: Priority of requirement implementation must comport with law and regulations.\n",
    "    - Prioritization techniques include ((ironically) in no particular order):\n",
    "        - ***Ranking and Grouping***: Assigning requirements with numerical values and grouping those requirements into different priority groups. Simple, but very subjective.\n",
    "        - ***Dependency Map***: Tree-chart of requirement dependencies to determine which requirements even *can* be done before others.\n",
    "        - ***Bubble Sorting***: Compare two requirements to each other, and order them by priority. Then, compare one of the requirements with a new one, and order. Continue until the last requirement is sorted.\n",
    "        - ***100 Dollar Method***: All stakeholders are given a conceptual 100 dollars. They can distribute the dollars among requirements any way they like, including a stakeholder putting all 100 dollars into a single requirement. The highest totals are prioritized first. \n",
    "            - This method is good for a small group of requirements. It is often used as part of focus groups of stakeholder-based elicitation.\n",
    "        - ***Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)***: A conceptual method of starting with the largest overarching goal, and then decomposing the goal into smaller sub-problems. Then, goals on the same level of the hierarchy are compared to each other.\n",
    "            - This method is also only good for a small number of requirements, as the number of permutations of comparison can exponentially increase.\n",
    "        - ***Five Whys***: A method of elicitation to challenge the priority of features perceived as important to the stakeholder but unimportant to the developer. Asking \"why\" five times or less results in getting to the core of the professed importance of a requirement, where the developer can adjust priority accordingly.\n",
    "        - ***MoSCoW Method***: One of the more widely used techniques due to its simplicity and ease of use, this method categorizes requirements based on necessity:\n",
    "            - *(M)ust haves (a/k/a \"Minimum Usable Subset\")*: these features **must** be included before the product can be launched. Examples include (a) being unable to deliver on the target date without this data; (b) not legal without the requirement's inclusion; (c) unsafe without it; or (d) cannot adequately deliver the business case without it (***see*** \"Business Use Case\" under \"Use Case\").\n",
    "            - *(S)hould haves*: Features not critical for launch, but are nonetheless important and high value. In other words, without the should have requirement implemented, the solution is still viable, and work arounds exist for the lack of the requirement.\n",
    "            - *(C)ould haves*: Desirable features but are less important. These are the \"nice to haves\", where they could be included in the ultimate product, assuming it is not cost- or effort-prohibitive. Really only difference between this and Should haves is relative importance.\n",
    "            - *(W)on't haves*: Features that were initially requested but have been explicitly excluded from scope of the project (but may still be included in a future phase of development).\n",
    "                - The MoSCoW method aims for a split of 60% Musts, 40% combined Shoulds + Coulds, and 0% Won'ts. \n",
    "        - ***Kano Analysis***: Categorization technique similar to MoSCoW, but it is done from the point-of-view of customer satisfaction. It is broken into five categories:\n",
    "            - *Must-be Quality*: Requirements that a customer expects and takes for granted, such as a hotel providing a clean room to a new patron, or the existence of a customer service line for a company.\n",
    "            - *One Dimensional Quality*: The requirement generates satisfaction if fulfilled and dissatisfaction if not fulfilled. For example, giving an estimated time on hold for customer service will generate satisfaction if the call is answered within the time but dissatisfaction if being on hold excceeds estimate.\n",
    "            - *Attractive Quality*: The requirement generates satisfaction if fulfilled but does *not* generate dissatisfaction if not fulfilled. An example is a hotel offering free food to its patrons, or a customer service center providing instant resolution to an issue.\n",
    "            - *Indifferent Quality*: A requirement that is neither good nor bad. The thickness of a milk carton is an example, as a customer does not care about that.\n",
    "            - *Reverse Quality*: It is an attribute of a product that was intended for high achievement and satisfaction but ends up achieving the opposite result to some or all customers. An example is a customer service center using a lot of jargon or pleasantries, or a cell phone that has far too many extra features. \n",
    "        - ***ICE Framework***: Developed by tech entrepreneur Sean Ellis, it is assessing an average score across three factors, each scored from 0-10, to determine which features of a product should be prioritized: \n",
    "            - *(I)mpact*: How effective does this product feature help draw the business closer to its strategic goal, whether it be increase market share by converting a customer, and/or increase capital by maximizing ROI? \n",
    "                - One way to to evaluate this is by determining how fast and/or far the feature advances a customer through ***AARRR*** (Initial customer (A)quisition, (A)ctiving and engaging a customer with the product, (R)etention of the customer for long-term product engagement, the generation of (R)eferrals from retained customers to new ones, and (R)evenue being generated from customer engagement).\n",
    "            - *(C)onfidence*: A measurement of the \"conviction required\" to warrant addressing a particular feature. In other words, how much evidence do we have to support the level of anticipated impact?\n",
    "                - A measurement of confidence values can be found with [this graphic](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*AwSnjz4xNlxY0f-rkUJ8oA.png).\n",
    "            - *(E)ase*: How much resources will be used to realize this feature? Though factors include analyses of cost-benefit and opportunity cost, time is usually the metric used for Ease. For example, Ease can be scored inversely by the number of agile/scrum sprint cycles multiplied by the number of developers used.\n",
    "            - After determining the scores, features are often categorized into three buckets: (1) *sprint backlog* (highest priority features); (2) *product backlog* (features that need to be developed for a complete product, but are not highest priority); and (3) *icebox features* (features that aren't going to be worked on any time soon but aren't officially thrown away as viable ideas, such as fixing low priority bugs or commonly requested yet low value features).\n",
    "                - A good visualization for ICE is a ***Pugh Decision Matrix***, which compares scores of criteria against scores of criteria of alternative solutions.\n",
    "        - ***GIST***: Where ICE deals with feature prioritization, GIST is the roadmap to effect & ship those features:\n",
    "            - *(G)oals*: The aggregation of *OKR* (\"Objectives\" (top-line goals) and \"Key-Results\" (measurable benchmarks to determine satisfaction of an objective)\n",
    "            - *(I)deas*: The activities that will lead to desired results. These are delegated to certain teams and/or individuals.\n",
    "            - *(S)tep Projects*: A breakdown of objectives into 5 or 10-week long sprint cycle projects. Useful for meeting quarterly targets.\n",
    "            - *(T)asks*: Bite-sized assignments within step projects that advance the development of an application. To come full circle, the priority of these assignments is determined by an ICE analysis.\n",
